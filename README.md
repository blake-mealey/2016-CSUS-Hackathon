# First World Problems Simulator

This was a group effort between Ben Roberts, David Sepulveda, Brandon Goberdhansingh, and myself.

Third place winner for the [CSUS](http://csus.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) 2016 Hackathon. The theme for the hackathon was "First World Problems"

## Try It

I plan on hosting this on my website using Unity's web player when I get the time, but until then you'll have to have Unity installed.
